        <font class="content-header">Introduction</font>
        <p>
            This post outlines my experience working at Magnet Forensics as a Software Developer Co-op for my fourth and fifth co-op terms. Through this placement, I further solidified industry skills I had gained throughout my first 3 co-op terms. I also used this placement to pick up new skills, learning these skills through various software development tasks. I will outline my experience learning these new skills throughout this post.

        <p>
            Magnet Forensics is a digital forensics company. They build software for a wide range of forensics purposes that help police departments and other companies complete investigations with digital evidence. Their aim is to help make investigations using digital evidence be more accurate while speeding up the process of analyzing large amounts of data on various devices.

        <font class="content-header">Job Description</font>
        <p>
            As a Software Developer Co-op at Magnet, I was put on the Review team and contributed to a large scale cloud software project aimed at helping speed up the time it takes to analyze digital evidence. I was tasked with a number of software development jobs, and due to the nature of the product I hardly ever worked on the same thing for more than a few weeks (which was an awesome experience that I’ll touch on more shortly).
            <br><br>
            In particular, I was primarily tasked with working on backend cloud related tasks. These involved working in AWS and Azure, as well as working with technologies and languages I had small amounts of to no experience with before such as Kubernetes, Docker and C#. 
            <br><br>   
            I also briefly worked on front end related tasks as well, which involved me learning more about React, Angular and various front end development practices. 
            </p>
            
        <br>
        <font class="content-header">Goals</font>
        <br><br>
            I chose this position at Magnet because I felt that it would give me the best chance to improve my skills as a software developer, while learning a bunch of interesting new technologies and languages that I can use to get a jumpstart on my career. Overall, this position delivered on all my expectations in terms of learning goals. As a result, I was able to achieve all of my goals that I set in the beginning of the term.
        <br><br>
            My primary goal for this term was to absorb as much as I could about the software development process. To me, this involved learning and solidifying my knowledge in everything from planning to implementation. This position gave me the opportunity to help plan and implement a new product at Magnet. This meant I could capitalize on this goal and truly solidify my knowledge of software development processes, what it takes to implement and complete requirements, and what areas I can continue to improve on in the future. 
        <br><br>
            Another goal of mine was to learn as many specific technologies as I could while I worked at Magnet. I knew that Magnet used a number of different technologies to develop products, so I didn’t have any specific tech I wanted to learn in mind and left myself open to learn anything that came up by working on whatever needed to be worked on. This allowed me to gain experience working with Kubernetes, Docker, React, C#, and a bunch of other new technologies and languages that I wouldn’t have necessarily had the chance to work with.
        <br><br>
            Overall, I achieved all of the goals I set out to achieve in this co-op term. I learned the most I had ever learned at a co-op over the course of my 8 months at Magnet, and this experience will be invaluable to my coming job search for full time employment.

        <font class="content-header">Conclusion</font>
        <p>
            My time at Magnet was a fantastic learning experience. I didn’t know going into the term what I would end up learning, or even what team I’d be placed on. However, I feel that the experience I gained at Magnet is incredibly valuable, and it helped that Magnet is fantastic at fostering an environment to learn.

        <font class="content-header">Acknowledgements</font>
        <p>
            I’d like to acknowledge everyone on the Review team at Magnet for making me feel welcome and for helping me with any issues I faced throughout the term, especially through experiencing the COVID19 pandemic. The Review team really helps facilitate an awesome environment to work in. I also wanted to write a shoutout to Andrew Vanderveen, as he was very willing to answer whatever question I had while working at Magnet.
